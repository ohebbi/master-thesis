\chapter{Material Science Databases}

There are multiple different databases for material science discovery available for every day use, some of them completely open-source while others are commercial. This chapter will give a brief overview of databases available for computational material science, and will serve as a toolbox for how to request information and what kind of python packages exist to process that information.

%The materials genome initiative


%Some of the open source databases are Automatic-FLOW for Materials Discovery (AFLOW), Khazana, Materials Discovery (NOMAD), Computational Materials Repository (CMR), NIMSMatNavi, ICSD, Predictive Integrated Structural Materials Science (PRISMS), Materials project, Citrine Informatics, The Materials Platform for Data Science, The Materials Data Fascility, Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and Jarvis. Many of the databases are equipped with their own API, while other requires third-party libraries to extract their information. In addition, for some it is required to obtain an API-key (which) to perform a query,

%This proves that the challenge of finding databases are non-existent, while the challenge of choosing the relevant databases are of a great extent.

\section{Fundamentals of a database}

A quick search online will reveal the tremendous escalation of effort for big-data driven material science the last few years, resulting in several databases that stores ab-initio calculation details and results. We will here distinguish between a \textit{cloud service}, which is a place to store independent databases for research and commercial purposes, and a \textit{database}, which is an organized collection of structured information. As an example, a cloud service can store several databases, but a database cannot host a cloud service.

To limit the quest of databases, we have restricted the search for databases and cloud services to include inorganic compounds obtained experimentally or by first-principles calculations, in particular DFT-calculations using \textit{Vienna ab initio simulation package} (VASP) \cite{Kresse1996}. VASP is a software for atomic scale materials programming. Table \ref{tab:databases} and \ref{tab:cloud_service} shows a selection of databases and cloud services that meets the given criteries, respectively.

\subsection{API and HTTP requests}

To extract information from a database it is convenient to interact through an \textit{API} (Application Programming Interface), which defines important variables such as the kind of requests to be made, how to make them and the data format for transmission. Importantly, this permits communication between different software medias. An API is entirely customizable, and can be made to extend existing functionality or tailormade for specific user-demanding modules.

The APIs that will be encountered is handled by the use of \textit{HTTP} (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which in its simplest form is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources. The protocol is client-server based, such as the client is requesting information and the server is responding to the request.

The most common HTTP-methods are GET, POST and HEAD, which are used to either retrieve, send, or get information about data, respectively. The latter request is usually done before a GET-method for requests considering large amount of data, since this can be a significant variable for the client's bandwith and load time. Following a request, the server normally responds with one of the status codes in table \ref{tab:requests}.

\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
\begin{tabular}{M{2.5cm} M{11.0cm}}
  \hline
  \hline
   Status code & Description \\
  \hline
  2xx & OK - request was successful \\
  3xx & Resource was redirected \\
  4xx & Request failed due to either unsuccessful authentication or client error. \\
  5xx & Request failed due to server error. \\
  \hline
  \hline
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{Numeric status code for response. The leftmost digit decide the type of response, while the two follow-up digits depends on the implemented API.}
\label{tab:requests}
\end{table}

A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) allows users to communicate with a server via a HTTP using a REST Architectural Style \cite{Battle2008}. This enables the utilisation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), where each object is represented as a unique resource and can be requested in a uniform manner. Importantly, this allows the use of both URIs and HTTP methods in an API, such that an object is represented by an unique URI whereas a HTTP-method can act on the object. This action will then return either the result of the action, or structured data that represents the object.

To provide a Python example, we can check the response by doing a GET request at the database Materials Project RESTful API in code listing \ref{lst:general_uri_request}. We use the preamble to version 2 of Materials Project, and add an API-check and an API-key. The response is shown in code listing \ref{lst:general_uri_response}. From the output, it is possible to tell that the supplied API-key is not valid, however, the request is valid.

\subsection{Open-source Python libraries for material analysis}
Many of the databases share convenient modules that are used to adapt, visualize, calculate or predict properties, making it easier for scientists to utilise the databases.
%matminer
%seamless module compatibility
The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is an environment in the Python programming language that includes several tools and modules for setting up, modifying and analyze atomistic simulations \cite{Larsen2017}. It is in particular used together with the cloud service Computational Materials Repository (CMR).

Another commonly used module is the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) \cite{Ong2013}. This is a well-documented open module with both introductory and advanced use case examples written in Jupyter Notebook for easy reproducibility, and is integrated with the Materials Project RESTful API.

Another exceedingly popular library is matminer \cite{Ward2018}, which is an open-source toolkit for material analysis written in Python. Matminer is powered by a group known as \textit{Hacking Materials Research Group} \footnote{Project's Github site: https://github.com/hackingmaterials.}. Matminer provides modules to extract data sets from many cloud-services and databases, with examples in table \ref{tab:databases} and \ref{tab:cloud_service}. Additionally, they provide the tools to extract possibly thousands of features from calculations based on DFT and more, and have modules for visualization and automatic machine learning. These tools will be examplified in the next chapter.

\section{Databases and cloud services}

Every database has its own speciality, and no two databases are the same. There exists entries that are fundamentally identical in several databases, but with different properties as a consequence of parameters used, such as the functional utilised in VASP or the relaxation scheme. This section digs up what exactly is each respective database's claim to fame.

\subsection{Novel Materials Discovery}

The Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) \cite{Draxl2019} Repository is an open-access platform for sharing and utilizing computational materials science data. NOMAD also consists of several branches such as NOMAD Archieve, which is the representation of the NOMAD repository parsified into a code-independent format, NOMAD Encyclopedia, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) for characterizing materials, and lastly NOMAD Analytics Toolkit, which includes early-development examples of artificial-intelligence tools \cite{Draxl2019}.

Databases that are a part of NOMAD data collection includes Materials Project, the Open Quantum Materials Database and AFLOW. They are all based on the underlying quantum engine VASP.

\subsection{Materials project}

Materials project \cite{Jain2013} is an open source project that offers a variety of properties of over one hundred thousand of inorganic crystalline materials. It is known as the initiator of materials genomics and has as its mission to accelerate the discovery of new technological materials, with an emphasis on batteries and electrodes, through advanced scientific computic and innovative design.

 %Some features, eg. density of state (dos), bandstructure, Pourbaix diagram etc., are characterized by using the module pymatgen.

Every compound has an initial relaxation of cell and lattice parameters performed using a $1000 k$-point mesh to ensure that all properties calculated are representative of the idealized unit cell for each respective crystal structure. The functional GGA is used to calculate band structures, while for transition metals it is applied $+U$ correction to correct for correlation effects in d- and f-orbital systems that are not addressed by GGA calculations \cite{Wang2006}. The thermodynamic stability for each phase with respect to decomposition, is also calculated. This is denoted as E Above Hull, with a value of zero is defined as the most stable phase at a given composition, while larger positive values indicate increased instability.

Each material contains multiple computations for different purposes, resulting in different 'tasks'. The reason behind this is that each computation has a purpose, such as to calculate the band structure or energy. Therefore, it is possible to receive several tasks for one material which results in more features per material.

\subsection{AFLOW}

The AFLOW\cite{Curtarolo2012, Curtarolo2012a, Calderon2015} repository is an automatic software framework for the calculations of a wide range of inorganic material properties. They utilise the GGA-PBE functional within VASP with projector-augmented wavefunction (PAW) potentials to relax twice and optimize the ICSD-sourced structur. They are using a $3000-6000$ $k$-point mesh, indicating a more computationally expensive calculation compared to the Materials Project. Next, the band structure is calculated with an even higher $k$-point density, in addition to the $+U$ correction term for most occupied d- and f-orbital systems, resulting in a standard band gap \cite{Setyawan2010}. Furthermore, they apply a standard fit gathered from a study of DFT-computed versus experimentally measured band gap widths to the initial calculated value, obtaining a fitted band gap \cite{Setyawan2011}.

AFLOW-ML \cite{Isayev2017} is an API that uses machine learning to predict thermomechanical and electronic properties based on the chemical composition and atomic structure alone, which they denote as \textit{fragment descriptors}. They start with applying a classification model to predict if a compound is either a metal or an insulator, where the latter is confirmed with an additional regression model to predict the band gap width. To be able to predict properties on an independent data set, they utilise a fivefold cross validation process for each model. They report a $93$\% prediction success rate of their initial binary classification model, whereas the majority of the wrongful predictions are narrow-gap semiconductors. The authors does not compare their predicted band gap to experimental values, but it is found that $93$\% of the machine-learning-derived values are within $25$\% of the DFT $+U$-calculated band gap width \cite{Ferrenti2020}.


\subsection{Open Quantum Materials Database}

The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQDM) \cite{Saal2013, Kirklin2015} is a free and available database of DFT-calculations. It has included thermodynamic and structural properties of more than $600.000$ materials, including all unique entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) consisting of less than $34$ atoms.

The DFT calculations are performed with the VASP software whereas the electron exchange and correlation are described with the GGA-PBE, while using the PAW potentials. They relax a structure using $4000-8000$ $k$-point mesh, indicating an even increasing computational expensive calculation than AFLOW again. Several element-specific settings are included such as using the $+U$ extension for various transition metals, lanthanides and actinides. In addition, any calculation containing 3d or actinide elements are spin-polarized with a ferromagnetic alignment of spins to capture possible magnetism. However, the authors note that this approach does not capture complex magnetic, such as antiferromagnetism, which has been found to result in substantial errors for the formation energy \cite{Stevanovic2012}.

\subsection{JARVIS}

Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) \cite{Choudhary2020} - DFT is an open database based based on the VASP software to perform a variety of material property calculations. It consists of roughly $40.000$ 3D and $1.000$ 2D materials using the vdW-DF-OptB88 van der Waals functional, which was originally designed to improve the approximation of properties of two-dimensional van der Waals materials, but has also shown to be effective for bulk materials \cite{Thonhauser2007, Klimes2011}. The functional has shown accurate predictions for lattice-parameters and energetics for both vDW and non-vdW bonded materials  \cite{Choudhary2018}.

Structures included in the data set are originally taken from the materials project, and then re-optimized using the OPT-functional. Finally, the combination of the OPT and modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) functionals are used to obtain a representative band gap of each structure, since both have shown unprecedented accuracy in the calculation of band gap compared to any other DFT-based calculation methods \cite{Choudhary2018a}.

The JARVIS-DFT database is part of a bigger platform that includes JARVIS-FF, which is the evaluation of classical forcefield with respect to DFT-data, and JARVIS-ML, which consists of 25 machine learning to predict properties of materials. In addition, JARVIS-DFT also includes a data set of 1D-nanowire and 0D-molecular materials, yet not publically distributed.
