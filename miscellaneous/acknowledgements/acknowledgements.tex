I was not certain that I would come out on the other side with a degree at all. For that, I truly have many persons to thank for pulling me through.


I'd like to thank my main supervisor, Morten, for being such an inspiring role model. I did not fancy studying until I encountered your positive energy and pure pleasure of research.
