\chapter{Introduction}

The year of the covid-19 pandemic, $2020$, was the year when humans emigrated the majority of their lives over to the internet. School classes, business meetings and social events were rescheduled into online lectures, emojis and comments like ``you're muted, Alan''. This emigration was enabled due to a mature silicon-based technology found in our computers and cell phones, which has been developed and improved over decades. These conventional devices are based on transistors, and can be in either state ON (1) or OFF (0), where we have seen an increased performance due to enhancement of clock frequency and reduction of transistor size as predicted by Moore's law \cite{Moore1965, Pavicic2006}. However, transistors are being mass-produced with the feature size at $5$ nm today, but are expected to reach a critical limit of $3$ nm in the following years \cite{Gwennap2020}.

To sustain the digital world's increasing computational demand, alternatives to the classical computer must be explored. Quantum computers are commonly thought of as a futuristic device, but are increasingly manifested today as a possible solution. The idea of quantum computers is to pass information in the form of a quantum bit, a \textit{qubit}, which can inhabit any superposition of the states $1$ and $0$. Unfortunately, there are substantial challenges associated with the modern quantum platforms simultaneously as the selection of quantum platforms is slim. The majority of discoveries of potential quantum platforms has so far happened by serendipity, and there is an urgent need for new and better materials that can escalate the effort for a sustainable future.

Conveniently, we are progressively recognizing the fourth science paradigm which consists of big words like \textit{Big data} and \textit{Data science}, which all comes together into making it possible to extract knowledge from data. In particular, we have during the recent years seen the rise of computational materials science databases \cite{Curtarolo2012, Curtarolo2012a, Calderon2015, Jain2013, Saal2013, Kirklin2015, Choudhary2020, Allen1987} due to successful ab-initio approaches alike \textit{density functional theory} \cite{Kohn1965}. This catalyst has enabled a new approach for novel materials discovery; instead of calculating properties based on composition and structure, we are now able to reverse the approach into selecting a key property and finding materials that maximise this goal.
Fueled by the new paradigm, we find a new field of material science known as \textit{materials informatics} \cite{Rajan2005}.

The present thesis is centered around the intriguing question; \textit{is it possible to build a model that predicts potential qubit material hosts?} The answer to this question requires intimate knowledge of the interdisciplinary space of quantum technologies, materials informatics and machine learning, which is the sole purpose of Part \rom{1}. In Part \rom{2}, we describe the process of extraction and construction of data, and the consecutive division of the data into three seperate experiments, or approaches. In Part \rom{4}, the main findings for each approach is presented and discussed. Finally, in Part \rom{5}, we provide a conclusion of the work with possible future prospects.

% It is specifically found that about 2/3 of the total progress in computation over the past 40 years has been due to materials/process innovations. More speculatively, materials/process innovation contributes at least 20% of the progress in all areas and the relative contribution of materials/process innovation to overall technological progress has grown in the past few decades https://doi.org/10.1002/cplx.20309
