Finally, as new calculations are continuously added to both OQMD and Materials Project, the analysis above corresponds only to certain snapshots of each database; however, we expect this conclusion to be valid as long as the chemical-potential fitting approaches are not significantly revised.

  abstract    = {The Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) is an integrated infrastructure to accelerate materials discovery and design using density functional theory (DFT), classical force-fields (FF), and machine learning (ML) techniques. JARVIS is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles of developing open-access databases and tools to reduce the cost and development time of materials discovery, optimization, and deployment. The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-Tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ~ 40,000 materials and ~ 1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ~ 1,500 materials and ~ 110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ~ 25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-Tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm. The databases and tools are publicly distributed through the following major websites http://jarvis.nist.gov/ and https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis .},

It leads to several other search-type applications - several examples are presented. Also, it leads to quantum mechanical algorithms for problems not immediately connected with search - two such algorithms are presented for estimating the mean and median of statistical distributions. Both algorithms require fewer steps than the fastest possible classical algorithms; also both are considerably simpler and faster than existing quantum mechanical algorithms for the respective problems.},

  abstract    = {Large databases such as aflowlib.org provide valuable data sources for discovering material trends through machine learning. Although a REST API and query language are available, there is a learning curve associated with the AFLUX language that acts as a barrier for new users. Additionally, the data is stored using non-standard serialization formats. Here we present a high-level API that allows immediate access to the aflowlib data using standard python operators and language features. It provides an easy way to integrate aflowlib data with other python materials packages such as ase and quippy, and provides automatic deserialization into numpy arrays and python objects. This package is available via "pip install aflow".},

  abstract    = {As the number of novel data-driven approaches to material science continues to grow, it is crucial to perform consistent quality, reliability and applicability assessments of model performance. In this paper, we benchmark the Materials Optimal Descriptor Network (MODNet) method and architecture against the recently released MatBench v0.1, a curated test suite of materials datasets. MODNet is shown to outperform current leaders on 4 of the 13 tasks, whilst closely matching the current leaders on a further 3 tasks; MODNet performs particularly well when the number of samples is below 10,000. Attention is paid to two topics of concern when benchmarking models. First, we encourage the reporting of a more diverse set of metrics as it leads to a more comprehensive and holistic comparison of model performance. Second, an equally important task is the uncertainty assessment of a model towards a target domain. By applying a distance metric in feature space, we found that significant variations in validation errors can be observed, depending on the imbalance and bias in the training set (i.e., similarity between training and application space). Both issues are often overlooked, yet important for successful real-world applications of machine learning in materials science and condensed matter.},

The proposed toolbox only depends on numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn and is distributed under MIT license. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with scikit-learn and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported project. Documentation, unit tests as well as integration tests are provided to ease usage and contribution.
